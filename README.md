# PDFRedactorJS

## Features

* Redact PDF files by drawing black boxes over sensitive data
* Output is PDF
* The processed files **do not leave your computer**. Everything is processed inside your browser.

**Warning:** Redacted PDFs are saved as images. This means that the text cannot be copied & pasted by hand from the redacted PDF. This is on purpose in order to not leak any hidden text.
